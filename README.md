## Project 2 - Part 4

#### Resources
I continued to use W3Schools as my main reference as well as the book JQuery & Javascript for the js coding.  For my plugins, I used:


(http://stickyjs.com/)
(https://www.jqueryscript.net/tags.php?/popup/)

#### Deductions
I have reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

#### Comments
I have most of the content and the required elements but need to fine tune them, clean up my code and make sure my plugins are working correctly.
