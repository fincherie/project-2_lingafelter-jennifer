## Project 2 - Part 3

#### Resources
I used W3Schools as my main reference for this initial phase of the project.  I created all of the pages first and am focusing on the basic styling of the elements including the mobile-first responsive design.

#### Deductions
I have reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

#### Comments
My approach for this project is to create the pages and the main styles and will work on the javascript and jquery events after I get the site to look good.
