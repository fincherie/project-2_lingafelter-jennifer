## Resources
[W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
I rely on W3 Schools for correct syntax especially going between html and css.  When I Google how to write or style something, I always refer to W3 Schools first because it provides the answer right away whereas StackOverflow and CodePen don't always provide the answer in an obvious manner.

I also had to watch the class lecture multiple times because the content was in there but there was so much to learn that I apparently missed some key learnings as I watched it the previous times before.

## Comments
This assignment is where so many things we've learned al came together and actually made sense.  I have found it easier to write the step by step instructions on how to do something because it's so easy to miss one step (especially on setting up a repo and cloning one) that it can prevent you from creating the new clones repo.
