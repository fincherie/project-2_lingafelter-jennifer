#### Resources

I continued to use W3Schools as my main reference as well as the book JQuery & Javascript for the js coding.  I have found that when I am stuck on a particular topic, I search on Google and several websites appear but they are forums that do not necessarily provide an answer or even the correct answer.  And for that reason, I would use W3Schools and play around with their code on the Try It pages, and see if I could get the results I was aiming for.

##### Custom jQuery

When you hover on the GRAD FOOD IS BEST section, it changes font color and background color and when you mouse out, it reverts back.

##### Custom javaScript

The form background color changes to a darker gray when the form or a field is clicked on.

##### Plugin 1

[Sticky Nav](http://stickyjs.com/)

When you scroll down the page, the header will stick to the top of the page.

##### Plugin 2

[Popup](https://www.jqueryscript.net/tags.php?/popup/)

When you click on the Download Now button on the Home page, a popup window appears to download the app.

#### Deductions

I have reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

#### Comments

I am happy about my ability to use Javascript and Jquery plugins even if they are minimal at the moment.  I have learned that I need to spend a lot more time thinking about the overall design upfront and all of the interactive elements rather than jumping right into designing the site and fitting the interactivity into an existing design.

This project was well organized in that it was broken down into sections which did not make it overwhelming to complete.  I liked it because it incorporated everything we have learned this semester which was a lot of topics!
